### Grounding

Making sure an AI's answer is based on real-world facts or trusted information.

### Hallucination

When an AI makes up information that sounds real but isn't true.

### Hyperparameter

Settings outside the model that influence how it learns.

### Inference

When a trained model makes predictions based on new information.

### Instruction-tuning

Training an AI to better follow directions given in prompts.

### Intent

A label in language tasks that shows the goal behind a phrase, like 'decrease volume'.

### Knowledge Graph

A map of facts and relationships between things, used to help AI understand information.

### Label

The correct answer or category given to a piece of training data.

### Large Language Model (LLM)

A type of AI trained to understand and generate human-like text (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude).

### Machine Learning

A way for machines to learn from data without being manually programmed.

### Machine Translation

Automatically translating text from one language to another.

### Model

The result of training a machine learning algorithmâ€”used to make predictions.

### Multi-modal AI

AI that can generate and understand different types of input like text, images, and sound.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)

How computers understand and work with human language.

### Natural Language Understanding (NLU)

Helps machines understand the meaning behind what we say.

### Neural Network

A computing system inspired by the brain's structure that helps machines learn through interconnected nodes.

### Normalization

A way to adjust values so they're on a similar scale, making learning easier.

### Overfitting

When a model learns too much from training data and doesn't perform well on new data.

### Parameter

A value inside a model that helps it make predictions.

### Pattern Recognition

Finding trends or patterns in data.

### Predictive Analytics

Using data and AI to forecast what might happen in the future.

### Pretraining

The first step in training an AI, where it learns general patterns from lots of data.

### Prompt

The input you give an AI model to get a response. It's like asking a question or giving a command.

### Prompt Engineering

Crafting effective inputs to get the most useful responses from AI models like ChatGPT.

### Reasoning

The ability of an AI to connect ideas or steps to reach a logical answer.

### Recursive Prompting

A method where the AI's previous answers are used to guide the next prompt.

### Reinforcement Learning

Teaching AI through trial and error with feedback to improve.

### Response

The output or answer the AI gives after receiving a prompt.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

A method where an AI looks up real information before answering to provide more accurate responses.

### Self-Attention

A way for AI to figure out which words or pieces of data are most important.

### Semantic Search

A search method that understands the meaning behind the words you use.

### Sentiment Analysis

Determining if a piece of text expresses positive, negative, or neutral feelings.

### Speech to Text

Technology that converts spoken language into written words.

### Stable Diffusion

A type of AI model that creates realistic images from text prompts.

### Steering

Guiding an AI model's responses to be more helpful, safe, or aligned with specific goals.
