## How It Works

### How Generative AI Works: Core Concepts

Understanding the fundamental principles behind AI systems like ChatGPT and Claude

#### The Building Blocks of Generative AI

Generative AI systems like ChatGPT and Claude may seem magical, but they operate on some simple core principles. Understanding these basic concepts will help you better utilize these tools and recognize both their capabilities and limitations. While the technical details can be complex, the fundamental ideas are accessible to everyone.

#### Tokenization: Breaking Language into Pieces

At the most basic level, generative AI systems process language by breaking it down into smaller units called **tokens**. A token can be as short as a single character or as long as a complete word.

**Example of Tokenization:**
"Welcome to BYU-Idaho" → ["Welcome", "to", "BYU", "-", "Idaho"]

_Note: Actual tokenization might differ depending on the specific AI system._

**Why tokenization matters:**

- It transforms human language into a format that computers can process
- The quality of tokenization affects how well the AI understands context and meaning
- Different languages and technical terms present unique tokenization challenges

**BYU-Idaho Example:**
When you ask a chatbot about "I-Center hours," the system needs to understand that "I-Center" is a specific location at BYU-Idaho, not just the letter "I" and the word "Center." Proper tokenization helps the AI recognize campus-specific terms.

#### Token Prediction: The Core of Text Generation

At its heart, generative AI works through **next-token prediction** - predicting the most likely next word or token based on everything that came before it. This is similar to how your phone's keyboard suggests the next word as you type.

**Example of Token Prediction:**
**Input:** "Students at BYU-Idaho are encouraged to..."

**Potential next tokens (with probabilities):**

- "participate" (15%)
- "succeed" (12%)
- "develop" (10%)
- "attend" (8%)
- ... hundreds more possibilities with lower probabilities

The AI chooses one of these tokens (typically with some randomness included), adds it to the sequence, and then repeats the process to generate the next token. This continues until the response is complete.

**Key Insights About Token Prediction:**

- Predictions are based on statistical patterns, not understanding
- The system considers the entire conversation history when making predictions
- Token prediction is why these systems can sometimes produce factually incorrect content that "sounds right"
- The predictive process is why AI responses can vary even to the same prompt

**Administrative Application:**
When drafting an email about a campus event, the AI predicts what information is typically included in event announcements (date, time, location, etc.) based on patterns it has seen. If you're writing about a devotional, it might predict terms like "speaker," "spiritual," and "Ballroom" because these tokens commonly appear in that context.

#### Understanding AI Limitations

Despite their impressive capabilities, current generative AI systems have important limitations to keep in mind:

**Hallucinations**
AI systems can generate content that sounds plausible but is factually incorrect. This happens because they predict what sounds right based on patterns rather than retrieving verified facts.

_Example: An AI might confidently state incorrect information about BYU-Idaho's founding date or misname campus buildings._

**Knowledge Cutoffs**
AI systems only have knowledge from their training data, which has a cutoff date. They don't have access to real-time information unless specifically connected to other tools.

_Example: The AI won't know about new campus policies, recent events, or administrative changes that occurred after its training cutoff._

**Context Limitations**
AI systems can only consider a finite amount of text at once (their context window). This limits their ability to work with very lengthy documents or remember details from early in a long conversation.

_Example: When reviewing a lengthy student handbook document, the AI might "forget" details from the beginning by the time it reaches the end._

**Lack of True Understanding**
While these systems can mimic understanding, they don't truly comprehend meaning the way humans do. They recognize patterns rather than understanding the world those patterns describe.

_Example: The AI can draft a communication about campus values but doesn't actually understand or believe in those values itself._

#### Practical Implications for BYU-Idaho

Understanding these core concepts helps you use AI more effectively in your administrative role:

- **Be specific with your prompts** - Clear instructions with relevant context produce better results
- **Verify factual information** - Always check AI-generated facts, especially about BYU-Idaho specific policies or data
- **Iterate to improve results** - Refine your prompts based on initial responses to get better outcomes
- **Provide university-specific context** - Include relevant BYU-Idaho terminology, policies, or values when needed
- **Understand the complementary role** - AI works best as a collaborative tool that enhances human judgment, not replaces it

This overview provides a foundation for understanding how generative AI systems work at a basic level. For more details on effective prompting and advanced features, see our other guides.

**Data Guidelines**
Do not input sensitive or protected information into AI tools. This includes personally identifiable student/employee data, FERPA-protected records, financial information, or proprietary university content.

**Academic Integrity**
AI use in academic contexts follows established guidelines for academic honesty. Students must seek permission from professors before using AI for assignments when not explicitly allowed and must clearly declare AI assistance when used.

#### University Values and AI

At BYU-Idaho, we view technology as a tool to help us fulfill our mission more effectively. Our approach to AI is guided by the same principles that direct all our work:

- **Building testimonies of the Savior:** Using technology to support our primary purpose of developing disciples of Jesus Christ
