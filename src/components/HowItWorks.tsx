              Tokenization: Breaking Language into Pieces
            </h2>

            <p className="text-primary mb-4">
              At the most basic level, generative AI systems process language by
              breaking it down into smaller units called <strong>tokens</strong>
              . A token can be as short as a single character or as long as a
              complete word.

                BYU-Idaho, not just the letter "I" and the word "Center." Proper
                tokenization helps the AI recognize campus-specific terms.

              At its heart, generative AI works through{" "}
              <strong>next-token prediction</strong> - predicting the most
              likely next word or token based on everything that came before it.
              This is similar to how your phone's keyboard suggests the next
              word as you type.

                you're writing about a devotional, it might predict terms like
                "speaker," "spiritual," and "Ballroom" because these tokens

                  AI systems can generate content that sounds plausible but is

                  AI systems only have knowledge from their training data, which
                  has a cutoff date. They don't have access to real-time
                  information unless specifically connected to other tools.

                  Example: The AI won't know about new campus policies, recent

                <p className="text-small text-primary">
                  AI systems can only consider a finite amount of text at once
                  (their context window). This limits their ability to work with
                  very lengthy documents or remember details from early in a
