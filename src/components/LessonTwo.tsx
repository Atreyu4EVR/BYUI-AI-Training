            Welcome to the second lesson of our AI training program. Now that
            you've explored what AI is and how it works, it's time to get
            practical. This section introduces you to <strong>prompting</strong>
            â€”the most important skill you'll need when working with generative
            AI tools like ChatGPT.

          <div className="mb-6">
            <p className="text-primary mb-4">
              A <strong>prompt</strong> is simply the instruction or message you
              give to an AI system to get a response. It's how you tell ChatGPT
              what you wantâ€”whether you're asking it to summarize a document,
              write a message, brainstorm ideas, or help with scheduling.
            </p>

            <p className="text-primary mb-4">
              Think of it like giving a helpful coworker an assignment. The
              clearer your request, the better the result.

              spark creativity, and deliver exactly what you need.

              Contextual prompting entails embedding pertinent information
              within the prompt to help the LLM comprehend the task at hand.
              This context can include background details, specific
              instructions, or examples, enabling the model to generate more
              coherent and accurate outputs. For instance, when requesting a
              summary of a document, including the document's content or key
              points within the prompt allows the model to produce a more
              precise summary.
